While research in green\nsoftware engineering is correspondingly increasing, little is\nknown about the current practices and perspectives of software\nengineers in the field. This paper describes the first\nempirical study of how practitioners think about energy when\nthey write requirements, design, construct, test, and maintain\ntheir software. We report findings from a quantitative,\ntargeted survey of 464 practitioners from ABB, Google, IBM,\nand Microsoft, which was motivated by and supported with\nqualitative data from 18 in-depth interviews with Microsoft\nemployees.

As such, these unique changes are worthy of study. In this paper, we present a definition of unique changes and provide a method for identifying them in software project history. Based on the results of applying our technique on the Linux kernel and two large projects at Microsoft, we present an empirical study of unique changes. We explore how prevalent unique changes are and investigate where they occur along the architecture of the project. We further investigate developers' contribution towards uniqueness of changes.

This linkage is typically based on bug-fixes\n    identified in manually-entered commit logs.  Unfortunately, developers do not\n    always report which commits perform bug-fixes.  Prior work suggests that such\n    links can be a biased sample of the entire population of fixed bugs.  The\n    validity of statistical hypotheses-testing  based on linked data could well be\n    affected by bias.  Given the  wide use of  linked defect data, it is vital to\n    gauge the nature and extent of the bias, and try to develop testable theories\n    and models of the bias.  To do this, we must establish ground truth:\n    manually analyze a complete version history corpus, and nail down those commits\n    that fix defects, and those that are not.  This is a difficult task, requiring\n    an expert to compare versions, analyze changes,  find related bugs in the bug\n    database, reverse-engineer missing links, and finally record their work for use\n    later. This  effort must be repeated for hundreds of commits to obtain a useful\n    sample of reported and unreported bug-fix commits.  We make several\n    contributions.

One of the proclaimed\n            benefits of the use of design patterns is that they decouple\n            functionality and enable different parts of a system to change\n            frequently without undue disruption throughout the system.  These\n            OOD  patterns have received a wealth of attention in the research\n            community since their introduction; however, identifying them in\n            source code is a difficult problem.

Recently, several studies have analyzed\n\trecorded changes to classes playing design pattern roles and find that the\n\tpatterns \"folklore\" offers a reasonable explanation for the reality:\n\tcertain pattern roles do seem to be less change-prone than others. We push\n\tthis analysis on two fronts: first, we deploy W.

Second, we study the effect of the size of the classes playing\n\tthe design pattern and metapattern roles. We find that size explains more\n\tof the variance in change-proneness than either design pattern or\n\tmetapattern roles. We also find that both design pattern and metapattern\n\troles were strong determinants of size. We conclude, therefore, that size\n\tappears to be a stronger determinant of change-proneness than either design\n\tpattern or metapattern roles, and observed differences in change-proneness\n\tbetween roles might be due to differences in the sizes of the classes\n\tplaying those roles. The size of a class can be found much more quickly,\n\teasily and accurately than its pattern-roles. Thus, while identifying design\n\tpattern roles may be important for other reasons, as far as identifying\n\tchange-prone classes, sheer size might be a better indicator.\n\n\t}\n\n}"}},{"node":{"authors":["Christian Bird","Nachiappan Nagappan","Premkumar Devanbu","Harald Gall","Brendan Murphy"],"editor":null,"year":"2009","title":"Putting it All Together: Using Socio-Technical Networks to Predict Failures ","award":null,"booktitle":"Proceedings of the 17th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","journal":null,"entry_type":"inproceedings","key":"bird2009pat","raw":"@inproceedings{bird2009pat,\n\tAuthor = {Christian Bird and Nachiappan Nagappan and Premkumar Devanbu and Harald Gall and Brendan Murphy},\n\tBooktitle = {Proceedings of the 17th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering},\n\tTitle = {{Putting it All Together: Using Socio-Technical Networks to Predict Failures} },\n\tpublisher = {IEEE Computer Society},\n\tYear = {2009},\n\tacceptance = {25\\%},\n\tlocation = {Bengaluru-Mysuru, India},\n\tabbrv={ISSRE 09},\n\tdate = {10-3-2009},\n\tpdf = {bird2009pat.pdf},\n\tabstract = {Studies have shown that social factors in development organizations have a\ndramatic effect on software quality.

Inspired by Kleinbergs\nwork, we approximate the steady-state of an infinite random walk on a subset of a callgraph in order to rank\nthe functions by their steady-state probabilities. Surprisingly,\nthis purely structural approach works quite well. Our\napproach, like that of Robillards \"Suade\" algorithm, and\nearlier data mining approaches relies solely on the always\navailable current state of the code, rather than other\nsources such as comments, documentation or revision information.\nUsing the Apache API documentation as an oracle,\nwe perform a quantitative evaluation of our method, finding\nthat our algorithm dramatically improves upon Suade\nin this setting. We also find that the performance of traditional\ndata mining approaches is complementary to ours;\nthis leads naturally to an evidence-based combination of the\ntwo, which shows excellent performance on this task.\n\t}\n\t\t\n}"}},{"node":{"authors":["Christian Bird","Alex Gourley","Prem Devanbu"],"editor":null,"year":"2007","title":"Detecting Patch Submission and Acceptance in OSS Projects ","award":null,"booktitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories","journal":null,"entry_type":"inproceedings","key":"bird2007dps","raw":"@inproceedings{bird2007dps,\n\tAddress = {Washington, DC, USA},\n\tAuthor = {Christian Bird and Alex Gourley and Prem Devanbu},\n\tBooktitle = {Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories},\n\tDoi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2007.6},\n\tIsbn = {0-7695-2950-X},\n\tPages = {26--35},\n\tPublisher = {IEEE Computer Society},\n\tTitle = {{Detecting Patch Submission and Acceptance in OSS Projects} },\n\tYear = {2007},\n\tacceptance = {38\\%},\n\tlocation = {Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA},\n\tabbrv = {MSR 07},\n\tpdf = {bird2007dps},\n\tshort_venue = {MSR 07},\n\tdate = {5-10-2007},\n\ttags = {mining, email, social networks},\n\tabstract = {\n\t\tThe success of open source software (OSS) is completely\ndependent on the work of volunteers who contribute\ntheir time and talents.
