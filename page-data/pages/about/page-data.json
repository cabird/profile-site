He is primarily interested in the relationship between software design, social dynamics, and processes in large development projects and in developing tools and techniques to help software teams.  He has studied software development both quantitatively and qualitatively at Microsoft, IBM, and in the Open Source realm. Most recently his work has focused on code review, use of branching in source code repositories, and release engineering. He has published in the top Software Engineering venues, has received four ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished papers, and his research has been highlighted in the Communications of the ACM.  Christian is an ACM Distinguished Scientist, received B.S. from Brigham Young University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
