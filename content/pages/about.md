I am currently a principal researcher at Microsoft Research working on Empirical Software Engineering as part of the Research in Software Engineering RiSE group. I received my bachelor’s degree in CS from Brigham Young University and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Davis, studying empirical software engineering in the DECAL group under my advisor Prem Devanbu.  I’m currently working on ways to use data to guide decisions of stakeholders in large software projects.

I currently work with Thomas Zimmermann, Denae Ford, and Nachi Nagappan in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) group at Microsoft Research.

For a complete list of publications, positions held, etc., please see my CV.

The following can be used as my bio for publications, speaking engagements, etc.
